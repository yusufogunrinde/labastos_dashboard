# Labastos Dashboard
The project is a dynamic sales dashboard for a fictional superstore called Labastos. Dataset was sourced from kaggle and was first imported to excel to examine the schema and create brief of the metadata. Some of the labastos goals requires future engineering of more fields. Hence, I proceeded my data cleaning process on MySQL and data was subsequently imported back to excel for analaysis and data visualization.
With the consiousness of security in mind, a secure passcode is created using the excel macro vba, which ensures that only authorized user can access the labastos insight.
If you're intruiged by how my secure pass came to live, read me through my published medium post.
